define('WELCOME','Welcome to our final project. Our main focus was to create three simulations : Ball beam, Suspension and Inverted pendulum. Here is simple description of them... ');
define('DESCRIPTION_INVERTED',' An inverted pendulum is a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot point. It is unstable and without additional help will fall over. It can be suspended stably in this inverted position by using a control system to monitor the angle of the pole and move the pivot point horizontally back under the center of mass when it starts to fall over, keeping it balanced.' );
define('DESCRIPTION_BALL', 'The ball and beam system consists of a long beam which can be tilted by a servo or electric motor together with a ball rolling back and forth on top of the beam. The significance of the ball and beam system is that it is a simple system which is open-loop unstable. Even if the beam is restricted to be very nearly horizontal, without active feedback, it will swing to one side or the other, and the ball will roll off the end of the beam. To stabilize the ball, a control system which measures the position of the ball and adjusts the beam accordingly must be used.');
define('DESCRIPTION_SUSPENSION',' The job of a car suspension is to maximize the friction between the tires and the road surface, to provide steering stability with good handling and to ensure the comfort of the passengers.Suspension systems must support both road holding/handling and ride quality,[2] which are at odds with each other. The tuning of suspensions involves finding the right compromise. It is important for the suspension to keep the road wheel in contact with the road surface as much as possible, because all the road or ground forces acting on the vehicle do so through the contact patches of the tires. The suspension also protects the vehicle itself and any cargo or luggage from damage and wear.');
